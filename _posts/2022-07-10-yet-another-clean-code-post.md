## Clean code A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

This is one of the greatest book I've ever read, it's written by Robet C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob). It was originally published on 2008. [**amazon link**](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

In his book, uncle Bob 'as teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmer―but only if you work at it.'.

I had the chance to read three times, and it helped me alot to make my code cleaner and maintainable. I imagine that you've find a lot of posts on the net talking about this book, and you're wondering to know why another post about it ?

## Why another post about this book ?

- It's always good to remind developers of how code should be clean to avoid the WTF/minutes
- It's my turn to share a content about this book :grin:
- In this post I'll resume the book with a **mindmap**, so developers can easily find necessary points about clean code
